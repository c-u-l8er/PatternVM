# PatternVM

A virtual machine for modeling and executing design patterns from Refactoring Guru in Elixir.

## Description

PatternVM represents design patterns as modular components that can interact in a network. It leverages Elixir's concurrency model and functional paradigm to implement classic design patterns in a new way.

## Features

- Modular implementation of design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Pattern interaction network
- DSL for defining pattern compositions
- Dynamic pattern loading
- Visualization of pattern networks
